        <div class="historiatexto">
            ㅤThe history of Windsor Castle dates back to the 11th century when it was built by William the Conqueror shortly after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The initial purpose of building the castle was to establish a strategic stronghold to protect the City of London and control the Thames Valley.

            Over the centuries, the castle has been expanded and modified by different monarchs, each leaving their mark on the structure. During the reign of Henry II in the 12th century, the castle was transformed into a massive stone fortress with towers and defensive walls. Henry III and Edward III also made significant contributions, expanding the castle and adding residential and ceremonial buildings.
            <br>
            ㅤIn the 14th century, the castle underwent further alterations under the reign of Richard II, who built the Round Tower, an impressive circular defensive tower. Later, during the Wars of the Roses, the castle played an important role as a base for various factions.
            
            In the 16th century, during the reign of Henry VIII, Windsor Castle underwent a significant transformation. Henry VIII built the King's Gallery, a majestic structure in the Renaissance style, and also expanded the royal apartments and St George's Chapel. During this period, the castle became an increasingly important royal residence, with regular attendance at court and ceremonial events.
            <br>
            ㅤOver the following centuries, Windsor Castle continued to be an active royal residence and was the birthplace and death of many British monarchs. During World War II, the castle was used as a refuge for the royal family and was protected from bombing.
            
            Today, Windsor Castle is the official residence of Queen Elizabeth II and remains an important venue for royal ceremonies and events. It is also a popular tourist destination, where visitors can explore the royal apartments, the Chapel of St. George and the castle's beautiful gardens.
